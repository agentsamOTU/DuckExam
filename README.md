Components
<br>
I chose to use an accelerometer for controlling the duck by tilting, which should give convenient control over two axes. The controller features two vibration motors to provide additional feedback during gameplay. There is a pushbutton located in the duck's beak, which can be used to honk. The honking can be used to interact with the environment as well as distract the opponent.

Assembly
<br>
The components are simply fastened to the designed housing using hot glue. The two pieces of the houseing contain screwholes to keep everything together.

This demo uses leds to simulate vibration motors, as the tinkerCad motors were very faint on video. When the player moves the potentiometers, which simulate the accelerometer, it adjust the intensity of the leds. Additionally, the honk button also puts the leds at full power. Ground and power are color coded black and red, while the other components each have a colour for their data wires.
